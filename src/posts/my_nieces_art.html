    <p>
      For my birthday, both of my nieces made me some art. I have a growing collection of their work at this point, but this time something struck me about the differences in their styles.
    </p>

    <h3>Pictures of Their Art</h3>
    <p>
      Both are portraits of me. Notice the stark difference?
      <br/>
      The top one was drawn by Sophia and the other by Juliana.
    </p>

    <p>
      To describe it like an art historian, Juliana’s work is in the style of <i>realism</i>, while Sophia’s is more like <i>abstract expressionism</i>.
      <br/>
      You can tell Juliana made choices to depict me as realistically as possible—with her color choices and the way I’m shaped.
      <br/>
      Sophia, on the other hand, didn’t consider how I looked in real life. She likely made choices based on how she felt, rather than what she thought would be the "best" choice.
    </p>

    <p>
      What their work immediately expresses is their difference in personality.
      <br/>
      Juliana is a <i>straight arrow</i>—she does well in school, follows rules, and behaves.
      <br/>
      Sophia is <i>silly</i> and a bit on the chaotic side—she plays rough, laughs hysterically, and likes to get into a bit of trouble.
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s fascinating that you can see these personality traits reflected in their art. And it tells us something deeper about the <strong>fundamental forces of human nature</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>Order vs. Chaos (Conscious vs. Unconscious)</h3>
    <p>
      Carl Jung would describe some of the fundamental forces of human nature as the dynamic tension between the conscious and unconscious mind—in other words, order vs. chaos.
    </p>

    <p>
      The conscious mind is the realm of structure and decision-making—the domain of order, ego, and rationality.
      <br/>
      The unconscious is everything emotional, dreamlike, and mythic.
    </p>

    <p>
      Children have more direct access to the unconscious because their ego structures are not fully formed yet.
    </p>

    <p>
      School plays a large role in developing those structures—which makes sense, since Juliana has been in school longer than Sophia.
      <br/>
      In school, you learn to "not do that," "keep your hands to yourself," and so on.
      <br/>
      It’s where you’re taught to keep your unconscious in check and follow rules.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sophia has more direct access to the unconscious, which is why her decision-making—especially in her artistic expression—is likely more based on feeling than on the rules of realism.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>The Key Is Balance</h3>
    <p>
      A large part of becoming a whole human being is what Jung calls <i>individuation</i>—the balancing of opposing forces:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Light / Dark</li>
      <li>Masculine / Feminine</li>
      <li>Reason / Instinct</li>
      <li>Chaos / Order</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The tension between these opposites is what <strong>fuels growth</strong>.
      Each force has its own energy, danger, and potential.
      The <strong>integration</strong> of these opposites is what makes us whole.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although it may seem like we’re meant to “overcome” chaos, Jung actually encourages us to embrace it—and to find a healthy relationship with it.
      <br/>
      Too much order and you're neurotic. Too much chaos and you're lost.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sophia and Juliana make great sisters because of their natural tendencies toward opposite forces.
      <br/>
      Juliana can teach Sophia to be more orderly and behaved, while Sophia can teach Juliana to let loose and tap into a more creative side of herself.
